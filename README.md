# CNN_Using_Numpy
## Tasks
The project include two tasks:
### 1. task one: Use the image data (vector) as input, and use Deep feed forward netork to train and predict the labels.
### 2. task two: Reshape the image data to 2D array and use it as input, and use convolution neural network to train and predict the labels
